# Sequencing China’s Carbon Dual-Control Targets: A DSGE Assessment of Emission‑Intensity Pathways and High‑Quality Economic Development

This repository contains the Python code to reproduce all simulations, tables and figures reported in the paper **“Sequencing China’s Carbon Dual‑Control Targets: A DSGE Assessment of Emission‑Intensity Pathways and High‑Quality Economic Development.”**

## Directory structure

```

├─ src/                  # All model scripts
│  └─ model_simulation.py
├─ results/              # Generated automatically when you run the script

## Quick start

```bash
# (optional) create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate       # Linux / macOS
venv\Scripts\activate        # Windows

# install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# run the baseline, loose‑then‑tight and tight‑then‑loose simulations
python src/model_simulation.py
```

The script generates:

* `parameters.csv` – calibrated parameters  
* `results_baseline.csv`, `results_loose_tight.csv`, `results_tight_loose.csv` – scenario outputs  
* A set of `.png` figures inside the working directory  

## Reproducing the figures in the paper

All figures used in the manuscript correspond one‑to‑one with the PNG files generated by a single run of `model_simulation.py`. No post‑processing is required.
